# Current Vim Goals

{open from anywhere with either vj or  vim ~/vj}

## Annoyed With
    
    > Slow Movement (hjkl)
    > no fzf , tmux, coc, or prime vimgame

## Experimenting With

    > relative lines in vimrc (:{line-number to jump to, which is curr+relative)
    > relative lines navigation
    > using dw, b, w for navigation in line
    > using tmux even if it sucks (might want to change binding for opening panes)

## Researching

    >prime video practice #1 and #2

    >add twitch chat in tmux with the code in this YT vid
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=Z6sEEbwngd0&ab_channel=Beginbot
    >more customizations to speed up my tmux workflow

    >primes vimrc and tmux respectively

    https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/tmux/.tmux.conf

## Low hanging fruit 
    >autocomplete plugin (coc) setup
    >use o to go into insert mode for the line above cursor
    >shift o to go into insert mode a line above cursor
    >lower case v for inplace line highlight
    >yy to grab current line
    >p for paste line below
    >shift-i to go the first character of the line (in insert mode)
    >/ goes into search mode ( * goes forward in search, # goes backward in search
    >f jumps to the character
    >t jumps to the character but not on top of it
    >shift-f and shift-t find in the reverse direction
    >use ; to move forwards in results and , to go backward
    >x deletes a single character
    >s deletes a single character and goes into insert mode
    >use c-w it will delete the word and then go into insert mode
    >shift-d will delete the contents of the rest of the line from where the cursor is
    >shift-c will delete the rest of the line from the cursor and go back into insert mode, properly indented (noice)
    > { and } to move up and down paragraph blocks, respectively

## Effortful fruit 
    
    >customize window movement with vim and alt-tab / numbers (no more mousey)
    https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html

    >set up relaying stream to the bottom part of terminal (togglable)
    https://github.com/davidbegin/chat_thief/blob/master/chat_thief/chat_logs.py
    
    >build nvim from source and transfer over old movements
    [not rn]
    
    >setup config for nvim in github
    [not rn]

#log 1 : june 6 22
# accomplished today

    >tmux setup (see tmux-instructions if you get confused)
    >fzf setup (ctrl-p for access; :Buffer for buffers and shift hjkl for scrolling)
